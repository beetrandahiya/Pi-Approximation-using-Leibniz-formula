# Pi-Approximation-using-Leibniz-formula
In this program, I use Leibniz formula to approximate the value of pi ( Ï€ ), Its one of the simplest way u can approximate pi

# About Leibniz formula
the Leibniz formula for Ï€, named after Gottfried Leibniz, states that<br><br>

an alternating series. It is also called the Madhavaâ€“Leibniz series as it is a special case of a more general series expansion for the inverse tangent function, first discovered by the Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama in the 14th century, the specific case first published by Leibniz around 1676. The series for the inverse tangent function, which is also known as Gregory's series, can be given by:

The Leibniz formula for 
Ï€
/
4
 can be obtained by putting x = 1 into this series.

 Considering only the integral in the last line, we have:

 Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, as n â†’ âˆž we are left with the Leibniz series:
